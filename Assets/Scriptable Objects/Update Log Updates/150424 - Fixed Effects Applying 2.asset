  updateLogPreText: 15/04/24 - Fixed effects applying 2
  updateLogText: BUG - Fixed effects from applying higher then 2 turns remaining
    on an initial cast. Also fixed turns remaining being increased higher then 1
    for each attack lot. Now fixed to only adjust 1 max after it's initial. And +2
    for initial casts.
