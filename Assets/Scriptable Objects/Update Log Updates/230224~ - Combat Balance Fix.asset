  updateLogPreText: 23/02/24~ - Combat balance fix
  updateLogText: Decreaed the amount of attack bar that increases for enemies if
    there are more enemies then heroes in the combat. At high unit differences, players
    would too often never get a turn amongst all the enemies having their turns.
    Fixed now.
